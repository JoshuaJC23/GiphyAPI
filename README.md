# GiphyAPI

Buttons are displayed with titles of tv shows. Displayed is also an input box for user input to add tv shows.  Input a show and click the button "Type in a tv show"; once done click on a button to display a certain number of gify pictures of the selected tv show button.  Gify will start out as still, and click to animate them; then click again to go back to still.

# Programming

I have a buttons functions to add buttons and display them to the screen.  I used an AJAX to use the GET.then function to call for the gify then responds with the appropriate tv show. Used still-animate, data-still, and still.
